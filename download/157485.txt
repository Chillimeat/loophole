Ubuntu Security Notice USN-4344-1
April 28, 2020

linux-gke-5.0, linux-oem-osp11 vulnerabilities
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS

Summary:

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel.

Software Description:
- linux-gke-5.0: Linux kernel for Google Container Engine (GKE) systems
- linux-oem-osp1: Linux kernel for OEM processors

Details:

It was discovered that the Intel Wi-Fi driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2019-16234)

It was discovered that the Intel WiMAX 2400 driver in the Linux kernel did
not properly deallocate memory in certain situations. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (kernel memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2019-19051)

Tristan Madani discovered that the block I/O tracing implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could use this to
cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2019-19768)

It was discovered that the vhost net driver in the Linux kernel contained a
stack buffer overflow. A local attacker with the ability to perform ioctl()
calls on /dev/vhost-net could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2020-10942)

It was discovered that the virtual terminal implementation in the Linux
kernel contained a race condition. A local attacker could possibly use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2020-8648)

Shijie Luo discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly check for a too-large journal size. An attacker
could use this to construct a malicious ext4 image that, when mounted,
could cause a denial of service (soft lockup). (CVE-2020-8992)

Jordy Zomer discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly check for errors in some situations. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
expose sensitive information. (CVE-2020-9383)

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 18.04 LTS:
  linux-image-5.0.0-1035-gke      5.0.0-1035.36
  linux-image-5.0.0-1050-oem-osp1  5.0.0-1050.55
  linux-image-gke-5.0             5.0.0.1035.23
  linux-image-oem-osp1            5.0.0.1050.53

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.
