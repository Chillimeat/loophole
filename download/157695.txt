Several security issues were fixed in Squid.

Software Description:
- squid: Web proxy cache server
- squid3: Web proxy cache server

Details:

Jeriko One discovered that Squid incorrectly handled certain Edge Side

crash, possibly poison the cache, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2019-12519, CVE-2019-12521)

It was discovered that Squid incorrectly handled the hostname parameter to
cachemgr.cgi when certain browsers are used. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to inject HTML or invalid characters in the

LTS, and Ubuntu 19.10. (CVE-2019-18860)

Cl√©ment Berthaux and Florian Guilbert discovered that Squid incorrectly
handled Digest Authentication nonce values. A remote attacker could
use this issue to replay nonce values, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
