Ubuntu Security Notice USN-4343-1
April 28, 2020

linux vulnerability
==========================================================================

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Summary:

Systems running on s390x architecture could be made to crash or run
programs as an administrator under certain conditions.

Software Description:
- linux: Linux kernel

Details:

Al Viro discovered that the Linux kernel for s390x systems did not properly
perform page table upgrades for kernel sections that use secondary address
mode. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or execute arbitrary code.

Update instructions:

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following
package versions:

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS:
  linux-image-5.4.0-28-generic    5.4.0-28.32
  linux-image-5.4.0-28-generic-lpae  5.4.0-28.32
  linux-image-5.4.0-28-lowlatency  5.4.0-28.32
  linux-image-generic             5.4.0.28.33
  linux-image-generic-lpae        5.4.0.28.33
  linux-image-lowlatency          5.4.0.28.33
  linux-image-oem                 5.4.0.28.33
  linux-image-oem-osp1            5.4.0.28.33
  linux-image-virtual             5.4.0.28.33

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make
all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have
been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and
reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed.
Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages
(e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual,
linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform
this as well.
